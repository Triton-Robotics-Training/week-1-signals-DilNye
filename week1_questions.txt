Question 1: Explain the difference between analog and digital signals.

Digital signals are discrete, and can only be 1 and 0, whereas analog signals can be any value in a continuous range


Question 2: Give an example of something that uses digital signals and how it uses it.

Wifi uses digital signals via phase-shift keying, and it shifts the phase of a carrier wave to alternate between 1 and 0.


Question 3: Give an example of something that uses analog signals and how it uses it.

AM Radio uses analog signals to communicate sound waves. More specifically, the amplitude of the waves are used to indicate the pitch and volume of a sound.
